# About EcoSwap
EcoSwap was born from a simple but powerful idea: making sustainable living accessible to everyone. We believe that small, conscious choices in our daily consumption can collectively create a massive positive impact on our planet.

Our platform helps you discover eco-friendly alternatives to everyday products, with transparent ratings based on verified environmental data. We evaluate products across three key metrics: carbon footprint, water usage, and recyclability to give you a comprehensive understanding of their true environmental impact.

Whether you're just starting your sustainability journey or are a seasoned eco-warrior, EcoSwap provides the tools and information you need to make better choices for our planet.
